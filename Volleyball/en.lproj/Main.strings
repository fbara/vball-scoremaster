\nMAIN SCREEN
To add or change the name of the teams:
1. Tap in the team name text box above the score
2. Type in the name of the team
3. When done, tap on the 'Done' button

To change the score:
1. Either tap or swipe the score with your finger
2. Swiping UP or tapping the TOP of the score will add 1
3. Swiping DOWN or tapping the BOTTOM of the score to subtract 1 (continued)

To change sides
1. Swipe either score box and they will both move, swapping locations
2. This is good to do each time time the teams change sides
3. Swiping the score boxes will not change the score unless you accidentally swipe up/down at the same time.  If that happens, just swipe the score up or down to return to the correct number.

To change to a new game:
1. Tapping on the Game number will add a new game
2. New games will change both scores to 0
3. Team names will stay the same, so will Ace and Spike numbers
4. Maximum number of Games is 7
5. To reset Games back to 1, touch the number several times until it goes back to 1

To start a New Match:
1. Matches are made up of several Games.  Tap New Match in the top left corner to start a new match.
2. A new match will reset both scores as well as the Game, Spike, and Ace numbers
3. Once you agree to start a new match, it can't be undone

SETTINGS
Change team colors:
1. Tap the box of the team whose color you want to change
2. Each tap will change the box to a random color
3. You can change one or both colors before you save
4. Tap the Save button on the top right to save your colors.  Color changes take effect immediately.

Send text message (SMS or iMessage):
1. Change the Notifications switch to ON if you want to send a text message after each Spike and Ace
2. Enter the name of the player that will be included in the pre-formed text message.  This part is optional but it will make the text message more personable.
3. Enter the phone number to where you want the messages sent.  You can only enter 1 phone number here but you can add additional numbers to each message prior to sending them out.
4. Tap the Save button to save your changes.  A red message will show to indicate your changes were successfuly saved.
**If you don't tap the Save button before you leave the Settings page, your changes will not be saved.**
5. After you do this, each time you touch the Ace or Spike numbers, VBall ScoreMaster will generate a text message formatted with the name you entered, the number of Ace's and Spike's, and the current score.  The message will automatically be addressed to the recipient you indicated.
6. Because Apple prevents apps from sending background text messages (for your own protection), you must hit the Send button to send the message.  If you change your mind, just tap Cancel.
