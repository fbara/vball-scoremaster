I don't send pop-ups to block your activity and remind you to please rate this app on the App Store, but I would appreciate it if you would take a few minutes and leave a review.  Here's how you use VBall ScoreMaster!
\nMAIN SCREEN
To add or change the name of the teams:
1. Tap in the team name text box above the score
2. Type in the name of the team
3. When done, tap on the 'Done' button

To change the score:
1. Either tap or swipe the score with your finger
2. Swiping UP or tapping the BOTTOM of the score will add 1
3. Swiping DOWN or tapping the TOP of the score to subtract 1

To change sides
1. Swipe either score box and they will both move, swapping locations
2. This is good to do each time time the teams change sides
3. The final scores of the last 3 games are kept next to their score box.  The winner's score is in red.

To change to a new game:
1. Tapping on the Game number will add a new game
2. New games will change both scores to 0 and will move the existing scores to the past score numbers
3. Team names will stay the same, so will the numbers under the Action Names
4. Maximum number of Games is 4

Action Names!
Action Names allow you to track up to 2 statistics for an individual player.
1. Choose your Action Names from the Settings screen
2. To reset the number back to zero, touch and hold the number and you will get a menu with options.  You can reset to zero or cancel.
3. Action Name numbers are not stored anywhere so if you choose different Action Name, only the name will change

Send a text message
There are 2 ways to send a text message:
1. If sending messages is turned on in Settings, every touch of an Action Name will format a text message for you to send, or
2. Touching the volleyball in the center will bring up a text message formatted for you to send

To start a New Match:
1. Matches are made up of several Games.  Tap New Match in the top left corner to start a new match.
2. A new match will reset both scores as well as the Game and Action numbers
3. Once you agree to start a new match, it can't be undone

SETTINGS
Changes take effect immediately.
Change team colors:
1. Tap the box of the team whose color you want to change
2. Each tap will change the box to a random color
3. You can change one or both colors.  Color changes take effect immediately.

Send text message (SMS or iMessage):
1. Change the Notifications switch to ON if you want to send a text message after each Action
2. Enter the name of the player that will be included in the pre-formed text message.  This part is optional but it will make the text message more personable.
3. Enter the phone number to where you want the messages sent.  You can also tap the + button to bring up your contacts.  You can only enter 1 phone number here but you can add additional numbers to each message prior to sending them out.
4. Because Apple prevents apps from sending background text messages (for your own protection), you must hit the Send button to send the message.  If you change your mind, just tap Cancel.
