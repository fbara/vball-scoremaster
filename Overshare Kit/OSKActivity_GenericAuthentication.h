 A generic authentication protocol for relevant subclasses of `OSKActivity`.
 
 Generic Authentication refers to forms of authentication that can't be managed by either iOS or Overshare. At this
 time, the only example is `OSKPocketActivity`, which uses the Pocket SDK to opaquely authenticate the user.
